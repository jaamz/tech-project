### Setting Up The Front End

Return to the root of the project folder and go to the `tech-front-end` directory and run `npm install`:
```
$ cd ..
$ cd tech-front-end
$ npm install
```
After the dependencies have been installed, you can move onto the backend.

### Running The Front End

To run the front end, you will need to have a console window open in the `tech-front-end` directory. Please note you should have the back end running before starting the front end.

Once `tech-back-end` is running, run `npm start` with `tech-front-end` console window.

You should be greeted with this screen.
